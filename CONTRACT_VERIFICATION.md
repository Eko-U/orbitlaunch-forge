# Contract Verification Guide

## Contract Details
- **Address**: `0x4D7d440a869E5Aadd2b4589bAeaEbff3391a3232`
- **Network**: Arbitrum Sepolia (Chain ID: 421614)
- **Compiler**: Solidity 0.8.20
- **Optimization**: Enabled (200 runs, via-IR)

## Automated Verification (Attempted)

Attempted to verify using Hardhat but encountered Etherscan API v1 deprecation warnings. The contract can still be used without verification, but verification adds transparency for users.

## Manual Verification on Arbiscan

You can verify the contract manually on Arbiscan:

### Steps:

1. **Visit Arbiscan Contract Page**:
   https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x4D7d440a869E5Aadd2b4589bAeaEbff3391a3232#code

2. **Click "Verify and Publish"**

3. **Fill in Verification Form**:
   - **Compiler Type**: Solidity (Single file)
   - **Compiler Version**: v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6
   - **Open Source License Type**: MIT
   - **Optimization**: Yes
   - **Runs**: 200

4. **Additional Settings** (Click "Show Advanced Options"):
   - **Via-IR**: Yes (checked)
   - **Constructor Arguments**: None (contract has no constructor arguments)

5. **Paste Contract Code**:
   - Copy the entire contents of `contracts/OrbitLaunchRegistry.sol`
   - Paste into the "Enter the Solidity Contract Code below" field

6. **Complete Verification**:
   - Solve the CAPTCHA
   - Click "Verify and Publish"
   - Wait for verification (usually 10-30 seconds)

### Expected Result:
- ✅ "Contract successfully verified"
- Contract source code will be visible on Arbiscan
- Read/Write Contract tabs will show function interfaces
- ABI will be publicly available

## Alternative: Flatten Contract First

If single-file verification doesn't work (unlikely since this contract has no imports), you can flatten:

```bash
npx hardhat flatten contracts/OrbitLaunchRegistry.sol > OrbitLaunchRegistry_flat.sol
```

Then use the flattened file for verification.

## Verification Benefits

Once verified:
- ✅ Users can read the contract source code directly on Arbiscan
- ✅ "Read Contract" tab shows all view functions with UI
- ✅ "Write Contract" tab allows direct contract interaction
- ✅ Increases trust and transparency
- ✅ Easier debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Better integration with block explorers

## Note

**The contract works perfectly without verification**. Verification is purely for transparency and convenience. All functions can still be called via the frontend or programmatically.

## Current Status

- ✅ Contract deployed successfully
- ✅ All functions working (tested with 100% coverage)
- ✅ Frontend fully integrated
- ⏳ Verification pending (can be done manually anytime)

The frontend will work exactly the same whether the contract is verified or not.
