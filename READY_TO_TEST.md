## 🔍 What to Verify on Arbiscan

After deploying, check on Arbiscan:

### Transaction:
- ✅ Status: Success (green checkmark)
- ✅ To: 0x4D7d440a869E5Aadd2b4589bAeaEbff3391a3232
- ✅ From: Your wallet address
- ✅ Method: registerDeployment
- ✅ Gas used: 80k-160k

### Contract (Read Functions):
1. Click contract address
2. Go to "Contract" → "Read Contract"
3. Call `totalDeployments()` → Should show count
4. Call `getUserDeploymentIds(yourAddress)` → Should show your deployment IDs
5. Call `getDeployment(deploymentId)` → Should show your deployment data

### Event Logs:
1. Go to "Logs" tab on transaction
2. Find `DeploymentRegistered` event
3. Verify:
   - deploymentId (bytes32)
   - deployer (your address)
   - chainId (421614)
   - metadataHash (bytes32)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Wallet won't connect?
- Check WalletConnect Project ID in `.env`
- Clear browser cache
- Try different wallet/browser
- Ensure wallet is unlocked

### Transaction fails?
- Verify you're on Arbitrum Sepolia (Chain ID: 421614)
- Ensure you have >$0.10 worth of ETH
- Check contract address is correct
- Try with higher gas limit

### IPFS upload fails?
- Check Pinata JWT in `.env`
- Verify network connection
- Look for CORS errors in console

### Success page shows no data?
- Check browser console for errors
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Verify Deploy.tsx passes state correctly

### Short Term:
1. Add user deployment history page
2. Implement deployment update functionality
3. Add pagination for deployments

### Long Term:
1. Deploy contract to Arbitrum One mainnet
2. Set up The Graph subgraph for indexing
3. Add analytics dashboard
4. Deploy frontend to production (Vercel/Netlify)

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Open browser console** (F12) to see detailed logs
2. **Keep MetaMask visible** to see transaction prompts
3. **Use small amounts** - this is testnet, but practice like it's real
4. **Test error cases** - reject transactions, use wrong network
5. **Try on mobile** - WalletConnect mobile wallet flow
6. **Document issues** - screenshot any errors you encounter

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Everything is configured and ready to test. The contract is deployed, the frontend is integrated, and the dev server is running.

**Start testing now at**: http://localhost:8081/

If you encounter any issues, check:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for API failures
3. MetaMask for transaction status
4. Arbiscan for on-chain verification

**Happy testing!** 🚀
