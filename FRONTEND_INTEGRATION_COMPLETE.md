## 📊 Expected Results Summary

### Gas Costs
- **registerDeployment**: 80,000 - 160,000 gas
- **Local Hardhat tests**: ~158k gas
- **Arbitrum Sepolia (expected)**: ~80-100k gas due to L2 optimizations

### Transaction Times
- **IPFS Upload**: 1-3 seconds
- **Transaction Confirmation**: 5-15 seconds on Arbitrum Sepolia
- **Total Flow**: ~10-20 seconds end-to-end

### Cost Estimates (at current gas prices)
- **Single Deployment**: < $0.05 USD on Arbitrum Sepolia
- **Mainnet**: < $0.10 USD on Arbitrum One

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Wallet Won't Connect
**Symptoms**: Modal doesn't open or connection fails

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` in `.env`
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Try different wallet or browser
5. Ensure wallet is unlocked

### Issue: Transaction Fails
**Symptoms**: Error after MetaMask approval

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're on Arbitrum Sepolia (Chain ID: 421614)
2. Check wallet has sufficient ETH (need > $0.10 worth)
3. Verify contract address in `.env` is correct: `0x4D7d440a869E5Aadd2b4589bAeaEbff3391a3232`
4. Check Arbiscan to see if contract is deployed
5. Try again with higher gas limit

### Issue: IPFS Upload Fails
**Symptoms**: Error before transaction popup

**Solutions**:
1. Check `VITE_PINATA_JWT` in `.env` is valid
2. Test Pinata auth: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" https://api.pinata.cloud/data/testAuthentication`
3. Check network connection (Pinata API accessible)
4. Look for CORS errors in browser console
5. Verify Pinata account is active and not rate-limited

### Issue: Success Page Missing Data
**Symptoms**: No transaction hash or deployer address

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for navigation errors
2. Verify `txHash` and `deployer` are passed in state
3. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check Deploy.tsx passes data correctly in navigate call

### Issue: Build Errors
**Symptoms**: TypeScript errors during `npm run build`

**Solutions**:
1. Run `npm install` to ensure all deps installed
2. Check all imports resolve correctly
3. Verify `.env` variables are prefixed with `VITE_`
4. Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite dist` then rebuild

## 📱 Mobile Testing

### WalletConnect Mobile Flow
1. Open app on mobile browser
2. Click wallet connect button
3. Select "WalletConnect"
4. Scan QR code with mobile wallet app
5. Approve connection in wallet
6. Complete deployment flow
7. Verify transaction on mobile

**Expected Mobile Behavior**:
- ✅ Responsive design adapts to screen size
- ✅ Forms are usable on small screens
- ✅ Wallet connection smooth
- ✅ Transaction confirmations work
- ✅ Success page displays properly

## 🚀 Deployment to Production

Once all tests pass on Arbitrum Sepolia testnet:

### Step 1: Deploy Contract to Arbitrum One Mainnet
```bash
# Update hardhat.config.ts with mainnet config
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
```env
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_MAINNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
# Keep same WalletConnect Project ID
# Keep same Pinata JWT
```

### Step 3: Build and Deploy Frontend
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder to:
# - Vercel
# - Netlify
# - IPFS (for fully decentralized hosting)
# - Fleek
```

### Step 4: Verify Mainnet Deployment
- [ ] Deploy a test chain on mainnet (with real but small amount)
- [ ] Verify transaction on https://arbiscan.io
- [ ] Check gas costs are acceptable
- [ ] Verify IPFS metadata accessible
- [ ] Test on multiple devices

### Step 5: Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] Set up The Graph subgraph for indexing
- [ ] Monitor contract events
- [ ] Track gas costs
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Plan V2 features
